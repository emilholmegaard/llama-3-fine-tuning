## When to Use Different Fine-Tuning Approaches

| Approach | When to Use | Hardware Requirements | Benefits |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| Basic Fine-Tuning | Getting started, simple tasks | 24GB+ VRAM for 8B model | Easy to set up, good baseline |
| LoRA | Limited GPU memory, faster training | 16GB+ VRAM for 8B model | Memory efficient, faster training |
| QLoRA | Very limited GPU memory | 8GB+ VRAM for 8B model | Extreme memory efficiency |
| Full Fine-Tuning | When maximum performance is needed | 40GB+ VRAM for 8B model | Maximum performance, no adapters needed |
| Custom Tasks | Special use cases | Varies by task | Tailored to specific requirements |

## Fine-Tuning Workflow Overview

All fine-tuning approaches follow this general workflow:

1. **Prepare Data**: Format your data as described in the [Data Preparation](../data_preparation.md) guide
2. **Configure Training**: Set up configuration files for your specific needs
3. **Run Fine-Tuning**: Execute the training process
4. **Evaluate Results**: Test the model's performance
5. **Iterate**: Refine data or parameters as needed
6. **Deploy**: Use the fine-tuned model in your application
